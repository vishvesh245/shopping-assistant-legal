    <h1>Privacy Policy: AI Shopping Assistant for noon</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: February 23, 2026</p>

    <h2>What This Extension Does</h2>
    <p>The AI Shopping Assistant is a Chrome extension designed to enhance your experience on noon.com. It uses AI-powered conversation to help users find products, compare prices, and discover deals in real-time.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Privacy</h2>
    <p>We prioritize your privacy. The AI Shopping Assistant does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII). We do not require account creation, and we do not track your identity.</p>

    <h2>Chat Messages & AI Processing</h2>
    <p>When you interact with the assistant:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your messages are sent to a secure backend server to be processed by a Large Language Model (LLM) API (such as OpenAI or Gemini) to generate shopping advice.</li>
        <li>Messages are processed in real-time and are <strong>not stored</strong> on our servers.</li>
        <li>Data shared with the AI is limited to the text of your query and relevant product metadata from the page you are viewing to ensure accurate recommendations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>The extension uses Chrome's storage API solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Save your chat history locally on your device so you don't lose your conversation if you refresh the page.</li>
        <li>Remember your preferences, such as language or search filters.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data remains on your local machine and is never uploaded to our servers.</p>

    <h2>Website Access</h2>
    <p>The extension only activates on <strong>noon.com</strong> domains. It does not access, read, or modify data on any other websites you visit.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services to provide the assistant's core functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>LLM API Provider:</strong> To process natural language and provide shopping recommendations. No personal data is intentionally shared with these providers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing & Analytics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Data Selling:</strong> We do not sell, trade, or share any user data with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> We do not use any third-party analytics or tracking pixels to monitor your browsing behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy occasionally to reflect changes in our practices. Any updates will be posted here with a new "Last updated" date.</p>
